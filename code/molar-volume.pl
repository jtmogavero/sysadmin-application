# This routine calculates the molar volume by first estimating the
# molar volume using ideal gas equation (PVm = RT) and recalculating
# the real molar volume using the ideal molar volume as "V" in the Van
# der Waals equation.  It then resubstitutes the new "real" molar volume
# and calculates again, repeating until the difference between Vcalc and
# Videal is insignificant.  (in this case 10E-6 difference)


# First things first, set the gas constant to the value we need to use
# and calculate the Van der Waals A nd B constants

use constant GASCONSTANT_R => 0.0820575;
$vdwa = (27 * $tc * $tc * GASCONSTANT_R * GASCONSTANT_R)   / (64 * $pc);

# Now we estimate the molar volume by using the  ideal gas equation 

$mvol = (GASCONSTANT_R * $input{'temp'}) / $input{'pressure'};



# Now I assign the ideal volume to the temporary volume place holder for use
# in the Van der Waals equation and initialize the loop counter

$oldvol = $mvol;
$i = 0;


# This is the main calculation...it takes the temporary volume variable and
# runs it through the van der waals equation to find a better molar volume, 
# then compares the two to see how much of a difference it made.  
# If the difference is less than 10E-6, it drops out and accepts the volume
# as the real molar volume, otherwise it reassigns the real volume to be the 
# new temporary volume and reiterates.  I've set a max numbner of iterations
# to be 100, though it will never reach that, this equation converges
# rapidly.
