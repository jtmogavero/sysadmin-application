Please answer the following administrative/personal questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range?
   (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with
   to the most you think you're worth. As stated in
   the position description, salary is negotiable)

I am least comfortable with 80,000/yr, which is my current salary before overtime 
and bonuses are factored in.  OT and bonuses put this amount closer to 90,000, though
my inflated sense of self worth refuses to let me put a maximum amount I think I am
worth because I consider myself priceless.  

That being said, the simple answer is 80-90k per annum.  

2. When can you start?

I would want to give my current employer at a minimum 2 weeks notice.  I am relied upon
very heavily for training/coaching and escalation of critical cases, and I happen to
really like my boss.  I'd hate to leave him hanging.  

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next
   six months that we should know about?

Nothing planned.

4. Any problem with dogs?

Do purse dogs count as dogs?  If not, then I have no problem with them, I have two
of my own.  My wife and I met because of my first dog.  True story.
