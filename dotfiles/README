In the last 5 years, I've worked at two different jobs.  At each of these jobs,
I have responsible for supporting or administrating thousands of Linux / Unix 
systems.  

As a result of always being on a different system any given day, and
often needing to observe proper change control, I have typically been unable
to customize anything to my specific needs.  

Thus, I've become extremely accustomed to using tools with their default behavior, 
so much so that it's bled into my non-admin computer usage and I rarely customize 
anything beyond fonts and wallpaper even on my personal computer.  It's a bad habit 
born of necessity of being an ssh vagabond.    


That being said, if I could dig up my old .vimrc and .ircrc files, I would gladly
provide them, but they've been long lost to the ether.
